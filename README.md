# sampoorna
Sampoorna is a one-in-all solution concept revolving around the women who fight one on one with various problems. With it's features encapsulating solutions for majority of the problems faced by modern day women, it is a tool one step ahead of the existing tech-based solutions to the problems.


# What it does üéØ
We came up with an Android app solution named **Sampoorna** especially designed to help those women who are busy in their lives and tend to ignore the signs and forget to take precautions. The main motive of our Application is to spread awareness among the women and serve as the only tool they would require to ensure their safety and good health. Currently, it has two feature:
1) SOS Feature: ensures safety.
2) Period Tracking Calendar: If you are wondering when you last had a period or would like to know when your next one is due, you can easily find out using this feature. 
  **Sampoorna** to minimize the problems of modern day women & help them to live a healthy and care-free life. 

# What's next for Sampoorna Android App ?‚ú®
1. We want to grow our community and make Sampoorna Application available to every woman in the world. To enhance accessibility of Sampoorna to rural women, we have planned to make the safety feature available offline too.
2. We will be adding features of blogs and health tracking to detect existing symptoms in the updated versions.
3. We want to promote Sampoorna to a much larger extent. Every single girl & woman should know about women safety, its precautions, and their health issues and their cures through this Application.
